H3: 32-40px (Desktop) / 24-28px (Mobile)

```

**Letter Spacing:**

- Display text: 0.05-0.1em (UPPERCASE labels)
- Body: Default (optimal readability)

---

## 🏗️ Layout Principles

### The Rule of Thirds & Golden Ratio
- **Not arbitrary**: Based on visual perception research
- Content areas follow natural eye movement
- Creates balanced, harmonious layouts

### White Space is Premium Space
**Real luxury = breathing room**

```
Section padding: 128px (desktop) / 80px (mobile)
Element spacing: 24-32px minimum
Line height: 1.6-1.8 for readability
Margins: Generous, never cramped
```

**Why?**
- Reduces cognitive load
- Highlights important content
- Creates premium perception
- Improves comprehension by 20%

### Grid System: 12-Column

```
Desktop: 5 columns max
Tablet: 2-3 columns
Mobile: Single column (content-first)
```

## 🎭 Animation Philosophy

### Less is More: Micro-interactions

**Professional animations:**
- **Duration**: 300-600ms (feels natural)
- **Easing**: ease-out (confident, purposeful)
- **Purpose**: Guide attention, provide feedback

**What to Animate:**
- ✅ Hover states (subtle scale, color change)
- ✅ Page transitions (fade-in-up)
- ✅ Image reveals (zoom on hover)
- ✅ Button feedback

**What NOT to Animate:**
- ❌ Flashy, attention-seeking effects
- ❌ Automatic carousels (poor UX)
- ❌ Parallax overload
- ❌ Loading spinners everywhere

### Animation Timing

```css
Fast: 200ms - Button clicks, toggles
Standard: 300-400ms - Most transitions
Slow: 500-800ms - Page transitions, modals
```

---

## 🖼️ Visual Hierarchy

### The Z-Pattern & F-Pattern
- **Z-Pattern**: For landing pages, hero sections
- **F-Pattern**: For content-heavy pages
- Eye-tracking studies show users scan in predictable patterns

### Contrast & Focus

**Professional contrast ratios:**
- Text on background: Minimum 7:1 (WCAG AAA)
- Interactive elements: Clear visual distinction
- Call-to-actions: Strong contrast without being loud

### Size Hierarchy

```
Primary CTA: Larger, bold
Secondary actions: Medium, outlined
Tertiary links: Text links, subtle
```

---

## 🏛️ Component Design Standards

### Cards: The Premium Property Presentation

**Anatomy of a luxury card:**
1. **Large image** (16:10 ratio) - Hero first
2. **Clear typography hierarchy** - Easy scanning
3. **Subtle shadow** - Depth without drama
4. **White space** - Not cramped
5. **Hover state** - Sophisticated lift

**Shadow philosophy:**
```css
Default: 0 10px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)
Hover: 0 20px 60px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)
```
Mimics natural light, creates depth

### Buttons: Clear, Confident Actions

**Primary buttons:**
- Dark navy background
- White text (high contrast)
- Padding: 16px 32px (comfortable click area)
- Hover: Slight shadow increase

**Secondary buttons:**
- Outlined style
- Matches brand color
- Same size as primary (consistency)

### Forms: Professional Data Collection

**Best practices:**
- Single column (easier to complete)
- Clear labels above inputs
- Adequate spacing (24px between fields)
- Visible focus states
- Error messages that help

---

## 📱 Mobile-First Approach

### Why Mobile-First?

**Statistics:**
- 70% of web traffic is mobile
- Mobile users are equally valuable
- Easier to scale up than down

### Mobile Optimization

```
Touch targets: Minimum 48x48px
Text size: Minimum 16px (no zoom)
Spacing: Generous (fat fingers)
Navigation: Simple, accessible
Images: Optimized, lazy-loaded
```

## 🔍 SEO & Performance

```

## 🎯 Conversion Optimization

### Clear Call-to-Actions

2. **Secondary**: "View Details"
3. **Tertiary**: "Save" or "Share"

**CTA Best Practices:**

- Make them obvious
- A/B test colors

### Reducing Friction

**Every click costs conversions:**

## 🌟 The Details That Matter

### Micro-improvements That Add Up

1. **Button states** - Default, hover, active, disabled
2. **Loading states** - Skeleton screens, not spinners
3. **Empty states** - Helpful, not just "No results"
4. **Error states** - Guide users, don't blame them
5. **Success feedback** - Confirm actions completed

### Consistency is Luxury

**Create a design system:**
- Component library
- Color variables
- Spacing scale
- Typography scale
- Shadow system
- Border radius system

## 💡 Key Takeaway

> **Professional luxury design is about restraint, not excess.**  
> **It's what you don't do that makes it luxury.**

Every element should:
- Serve a purpose
- Enhance the experience
- Build trust
- Convert visitors

**The goal isn't to impress designers—it's to convert clients.**

---

**Remember:** Real estate is about homes, not homepages. The design should showcase properties, not itself.
